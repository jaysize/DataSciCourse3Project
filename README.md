# DataSciCourse3Project
Final project for Getting and Cleaning Data - the third course of Data Science Specialization

# Synopsis
The goal of this course and this project are to demonstrate how to retreive, clean and organize a data set from an particular source so that it is tidy and ready for data science analysis.

# Code Outline
Download main data sets -> Dowload files pertinent for labeling the main data -> Rename the labels -> Join the labels to the main sets -> Combine the main data sets to a single large set -> Summarize by taking the average for each activity/subject combination

# Motivation
This is created to demonstrate personal capability but also to serve as a reference to others on one of the many ways to process the Human Activity Recognition files from UCI.

# Installation
No complex installation is necessary.  Just cut and paste the code to your R environment.

# Tests
This code will completely execute all that is necessary to the user's current working directory.
